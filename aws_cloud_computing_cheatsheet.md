AWS Cloud Computing Concepts

Cloud Computing is the on-demand deliver of compute power,
database storage, applications, and other IT resources through a cloud
services platform via the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

Cloud computing provides a simple way to access servers, storage, databases,
and a broad set of application services over the Internet.

The 6 Advantages of Cloud
    1. Trade capital expense for variable expense
    2. Benefit from massive economies of scale
    3. Stop guessing about capacity.
    4. Increase speed and agility.
    5. Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers.
    6. Go global in minutes.


| Advantage                                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Trade Capital expense for variable expense               | Instead of having to invest heavily in data centers  and servers before you know how you're going to use  them, you can pay only                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Benefit from massive economies of scale                  | By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower  variable cost than you can get on your own.  Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers  is aggregated in the cloud, providers such as AWS can  achieve higher economies of scale, which translates into lower pay as-you-go price.                                                                                                        |
| Stop guessing about capacity                             | Eliminate guessing on your infrastructure capacity needs. When you make a capacity decision prior to deploying an  application, you often end up either sitting on expensive  idle resources or dealing with limited capacity. With cloud computing, these problems go away. You can access as much or as little capacity as you need and scale up and down as required with only a few minutes’ notice. |
| Increase speed and agility                               | In a cloud computing environment, new IT resources are only  a click away, which means that you reduce the time to make  those resources available to your developers from weeks to  just minutes. This results in a dramatic increase in agility for the  organization since the cost and time it takes to experiment  and develop is significantly lower.                                              |
| Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers | Focus on projects that differentiate your business, not the  infrastructure. Cloud computing lets you focus on your own  customers, rather than on the heavy lifting of racking,  stacking, and powering servers.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Go global in minutes                                     | Easily deploy your application in multiple regions around  the world with just a few clicks. This means you can provide  lower latency and a better experience for your customers at minimal cost.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Cloud Computing Models:
    * Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
    * Platform as a Service (PaaS)
    * Software as a Service (SaaS)


| Cloud Computing Model              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) | Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) contains the basic  building blocks for cloud IT and typically provide  access to networking features, computers (virtual  or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. IaaS provides you with the highest level of flexibility  and management control over your IT resources and is  very similar to the existing IT resources that many IT  departments and developers are familiar with today.                                                                               |
| Platform as a Service (PaaS)       | Platform as a Service (PaaS) removes the need for  your organization to manage the underlying  infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems)  and allows you to focus on the deployment and management  of your applications. This helps you be more efficient as you don’t need to  worry about resource procurement, capacity planning,  software maintenance, patching, or any of the other  undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running  your application.                                           |
| Software as a Service (SaaS)       | SaaS is a service model where software applications  are delivered over the Internet. In the consumer  space, examples include Gmail, Facebook and Dropbox  – these services are ready to use, no coding required,  you just use them. With SaaS the entire stack is managed for you,  though you will often have some limited scope to configure  the service according to your needs. SaaS is the second most popular cloud computing service  model for enterprises, totaling around 24% of all  enterprise workloads. |
