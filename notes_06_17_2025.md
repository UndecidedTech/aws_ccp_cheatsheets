AWS CCP Notes

```
I passed the CCP exam this week after studying for 10 days with 2 consecutive days off using AWS skill-builder and digitalcloud.training.
I took two practice tests daily from digitalcloud.training and reviewed all module quizzes, practice, and official pre-tests in skill-builder at least 3-5 times.
Digitalcloud.trainingâ€™s practice tests use similar verbiage and cover more exam topics than AWS skill-builder study questions.
I recommend dedicating 75% of your study time to digitalcloud.training and 25% to the AWS skill-builder.
```

Something to think about as I study.

```
If you have a super junior profile : Do you feel like you now have a better grasp of the benefits and drawbacks of cloud computing versus on-premise ? Are you able to recall the pillars of the well-architected framework and to explain why they are relevant?
If you have a dev/architect profile : Do you now feel more comfortable doing any kind of useful/productive work in AWS after gaining this cert ? Have you gained any autonomy or are you still glued to online guides and replicating 100% of the steps to complete a project?
If you have a functional analyst/business analyst profile, do you feel like you're now better at evaluating if an AWS product matches a projects requirements, and to compare it to other solutions on the market ?
This should answer your question.
If you're looking for practical projects to showcase your cert, look up the cloud resume challenge - sounds like it'll be relevant for you as a high schooler. I used to be triple foundation-certified (AWS,GCP,Azure)

AWS Direct Connect

    Private/Dedicated connection between your datacenter, office, co-location and AWS.
    Direct connect has two very-fast network connection options:
        1. Lower bandwidth 50MBps-500MBps
        2. Higher bandwidth 1GBps-10GBps

note: a co-location (aka carrier-hotel) is a data center where equipment, space, and bandwidth are available for rental to retail customers

Helps reduce network costs and increase bandwidth throughput -- provides more consistent
experience than a typical internet based connection. (reliable and secure)

Global Infrastructure - Direct Connect Locations

Direct Connect Locations are trusted partnered datacenters that you can establish a dedicated high speed, low-latency connection from your on-premise to AWS.

Global Infrastructure - Local Zones

Local Zones - datacenters located very close to a densely populated area to provide single-digit millisecond low latency performance (eg. 7ms) for that area.
    * Los Angeles, California was the first local zone to be deployed
        * it is a logical extension of the US-West Region
        * the identifier looks like the following: us-west-2-lax-1a
    * Only specific AWS services have been made available

WHATS WORTH REMEMBERING: The purpose is that it's a support for highly-demanding applications to sensitive latencies:
    * Media and Entertainment
    * Electronic Design Automation
    * Ad-Tech
    * Machine Learning

Global Infrastructure - Wavelength Zones

Wavelength Zones - allow for edge-computing on 5G networks. Applications will have ultra-low latency being as close as possible to the users.

AWS has partnered with various telecom companies to utilize their 5G networks
You create a subnet tied to a wavelength zone and then you can launch VMs to the edge of the targeted 5G networks.

Global Infrastructure - Data Residency

What is Data Residency?
The physical or geographical location of where an organization or cloud resources reside.

What is Compliance Boundaries?
A regulatory requirement by a gov't or org that requires where data and cloud resources are allowed to reside

What is Data Sovereignty?
the jurisdictional control or legal authority that can be asserted over data because it's physical location is within jurisdictional boundaries.

AWS Outposts is physical rack of servers that you can put in your data center.
Your data will reside whereever the Outpost Physically resides.

AWS Config is a policy as code service. you can create rules to continuously check AWS resources configuration.
If they deviate from your expectations you are alerted or AWS config can in some cases auto-remediate

IAM policies can be written to explicitly deny access to specific AWS regions. A Service Control Policy (SCP) are permissions applied organization wide.

Global Infrastructure - AWS for government

Public Sector:
    * military
    * law enforcement
    * public education
    * healthcare
    * government itself
    * public transit
    * infrastructure

AWS has special regions for regulatory compliance programs along with specific governance and security controls
It's called: GovCloud

Global Infrastructure - GovCloud

FedRAMP - Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program
    US government-wide program that provides a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services.

What is GovCloud?
    A cloud service provider (CSP) generally will offer an isolated region to run FedRAMP workloads.

AWS GovCloud will allow customers to host sensitive Controlled Unclassified Information and other types of regulated workloads.

GovCloud regions are only operated by employees who are US Citizens on US Soil.
They are only accessible to US entitites and root account holders who pass a screening process
Customers can architect solitions that comply with:
FEDRAMP high baseline
DOJ's Criminal Justice Information Systems (CJIS) Security Policy
US International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)
Export Administration Regulations (EAR)
Department of Defense (DoD) Cloud Computing Secuirty Requirements Guide

Global Infrastructure - AWS in China
AWS china is the AWS cloud offering in Mainland China
AWS China is completely isolate intentionally from AWS Global to meet regulatory compliance for Mainland China

In order to operate in AWS China Region you need to have a chinese Business License (ICP license)
Not all services are available in china eg. Route 53
Running in Mainland CHina (instead of Singapore) means you would not need to traverse The Great Firewall.

AWS has 2 regions in Mainland China: Beijing (CN-North-1, operated by SINNET), and Ningxia (CN-NorthWest-1, operated by NSWCF)

Global Infrastructure -- Sustainability
The Climate Pledge: Amazon co-founded the climate pledge to achieve Net-Zero Carbon emissions by 2040 across all of Amazon's business, this includes AWS

AWS Clouds Sustainability goals are composed of three parts:
1. Renewable Energy
    AWS is working twoards having their AWS global infrastructure powered by 100% renewable energy by 2025.
2. Cloud Efficiency
    AWS infrastructure is 3.6 more energy efficient than the median of US enterprise data centers surveyed.
3. Water Stewardship
    Direct evaporative technology to cool our datacenter, use of non-potable water for cooling purposes (recycled water)
    On-site water treatement allows them to remove scale-forming minerals and reuse water for more cycles
    water efficiency metrics to determine and monitor optimal water use for each AWS region
